## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted ocean blue (#558BBD), inspired by clear audio waves and technological precision. #558BBD complements a dark background.
- Background color: Deep slate (#2C3E50) to create a focused and professional environment that ensures that text contrasts well and allows the primary color to stand out without causing distractions.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#D0BFFF). It provides a gentle contrast that does not overwhelm the dark color scheme, to subtly highlight user interface elements such as call to action or toggles.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, provides a clean, modern and readable appearance that ensures clarity for transcription text and UI elements.
- A set of minimalistic icons will visually represent controls (play, pause, stop) to enhance ease of navigation.
- A layout using a clean, modern design, putting emphasis on readable text; controls grouped at the top of the app with the configuration options grouped in a collapsible panel to increase readability.
- Use of animated icons (spinners, progress bars, loaders, etc.) during file uploads and transcriptions
